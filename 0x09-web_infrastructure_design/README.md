# 0x09-web_infrastructure_design

During my project on web infrastructure design, I gained valuable knowledge about several important components that make up a web application stack. One of the key concepts that I learned was the LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) stack, which is a popular open-source web platform used to deploy web applications. I also learned about SPOF, or Single Point of Failure, and QPS, or Queries Per Second, which are important performance metrics to consider when designing a web infrastructure. SPOF is a component that can cause the entire system to fail if it stops working, while QPS measures the number of database queries that can be executed per second for a given web application. By understanding these concepts, I can build better, more reliable web applications.

In addition to learning about the LAMP stack and performance metrics, I also gained an understanding of load balancing, which is a technique used to distribute traffic across multiple servers and avoid overloading any one server. Furthermore, I learned about the Domain Name System (DNS), which is responsible for translating domain names into IP addresses, and the importance of selecting appropriate web servers and servers for my infrastructure. Lastly, I got to know more about web application firewalls (WAFs), which are critical to protecting web applications from a variety of cyber threats. Thanks to my project, I now have a solid foundation in web infrastructure design that I can use to create and maintain high-performing, secure web applications.
